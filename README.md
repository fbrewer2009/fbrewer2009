- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... getting my application MMDE, a MMIX Development Environment, to the alpha test stage.

I currently, summer 2022, have most of the modules in partial working order, not really up to full alpha stage.

If you are interested in same, email me at fbrewer2009@gmail.com.  Beware: Java ahead.
